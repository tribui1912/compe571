### Experiment 1: Finding the best quantum value for Round Robin Scheduling

Use experiment_1.sh to run the experiment and experiment_1.py to plot the results of the experiment.

### Experiment 2: Best quantum value for MLFQ

Use experiment_2.sh to run the experiment and experiment_2.py to plot the results of the experiment.

### Experiment 3: Comparing the performance of different scheduling algorithms

Use response_time_script.sh to run the experiment and average.py to plot the results of the experiment.

### Extra Credit: Context switch times for different scheduling algorithms and cases

Use context_switch_script.sh to run the experiment and graph_context_switch.py to plot the results of the experiment.
