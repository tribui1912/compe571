If test cannot run, you might need to add execution permission to the file

  run 'sudo chmod +x script_name.sh' 

Now it should work fine 

Multithreaded test is written to file for ease of reading

Added python script to graph for multithreaded data

  run 'python3 sum_multithreaded_graph.py'

Now the data should be display in a graph (output file)
